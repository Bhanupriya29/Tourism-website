                <b>Travel dreams $ destinations </b>is a tourist guide website
                for those traveling to India. Our primary goal is to provide a
                guide and relevant information that will assist tourists
                planning to visit India. We also provide information on the
                lesser-known areas that will make a great vacation spot for
                those traveling to India. Tourism has been identified as one of
                the major sectors that contribute as much as 9 percent to the
                national GDP of India. Encouraging tourism to India is not only
                doing the economy a favor but helping to foster unity in the
                world. Encouraging tourism is also a way of helping people to
                take a break from their busy schedule to relax which is
                generally good for maintaining optimal health.

                <h2>Our Belief</h2>
                We believe that a great number of people aspire to travel to
                India but are not sure how to go about it. We have provided
                articles on the rules and requirements that travelers will need
                to abide by when they want to travel to India. This will make
                vacation planning much easier.

                The rise in technology has made the act of booking hotels
                simpler than ever. However, relying on agencies can save you
                some stress that may arise when you use online booking. We have
                had instances of network failures during online transactions
                which interfere with bookings and this has often resulted in
                serious issues. We compare the pros and cons of using tour
                agencies against doing it yourself.

                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                India Tourist Office is committed to bringing all the latest
                news and information regarding tourism in India to our esteemed
                readers. We know that tourism is a multi-faceted sector with
                lots of key players and potential. We commit ourselves to
                providing you with information that has been simplified for ease
                of comprehension.

                Several regions of the world have a misconception about India.
                There are countries that see India as nothing other than a poor,
                third-world nation. Traveling to India and witnessing the
                various cultures will help them to dispel these negative ideas.
                As India pushes towards a more bilateral relationship with the
                rest of the world, we are certain that India will one day rise
                to become one of the top three tourism hubs in the world.
                <br></br> We accept the responsibility to champion the growth of
                India’s inbound tourism through providing interesting
                information on the different tourist locations scattered all
                over the country. While doing this, we will maintain utmost
                respect for our neighbors

                <h2>Our Vission</h2>
                India Tourist Office is looking forward to a time when the
                tourism sector in India will grow to provide at least a quarter
                of the nation’s GDP, as well as promote the unity of the diverse
                cultures in the country.

                <h2> The Future</h2>
                There is a myriad of cultures in the world. These different
                cultures should not be a source of division but a factor that
                unites us. We should be enthusiastic to learn each other’s
                culture and traditions. To get to this point, the nations of the
                world should focus on developing their tourism sectors. The loss
                of different cultural elements in various parts of the world can
                be avoided if more emphasis is put on tourism. Some cultures are
                going extinct and this is bad news for our collective existence.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                In addition to being a foreign exchange earner, tourism has the
                potential to eliminate unemployment. The rise in crime is often
                linked to unemployment. When more of the nation’s population is
                employed, we will have a more peaceful society to live in.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Through interacting with one another, we will be able to deal
                with stereotypes in all their forms, highlight our collective
                unity and foster peace. Together we can build a world where
                everyone is treated equally, irrespective of their race or
                culture.
